## 02. What Is AWS? What Is Cloud Computing?

AWS => Amazon Web Services => A subsidiary of Amazon (amazon.com) => A cloud computing services provider

Cloud computing => the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing

AWS, Azure, Google Cloud => own and operate IT resources and infrastructure in their own data center distributing entire world

Customers => use the cloud infrastructure => rent and use IT resources managed by AWS via its services => services are built on top of IT infrastructure, eg. AWS EC2, AWS Lambda

AWS provides dozens of services like database services, file storage services, data analytics services

AWS does heavy lifting

Flexible usage of compute power, no need to maintain own data center, only pay for the resources that are used
