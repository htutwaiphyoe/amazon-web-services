# AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01) | A complete introduction to AWS

course by Maximilian

## 01. Introduction

Certified AWS Cloud Practitioner

## 02. What Is AWS? What Is Cloud Computing?

AWS => Amazon Web Services => A subsidiary of Amazon (amazon.com) => A cloud computing services provider

Cloud computing => the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing (pay what you are using)

AWS, Azure, Google Cloud => own and operate IT resources and infrastructure in their own data center distributing entire world

Customers => use the cloud infrastructure from providers => rent and use IT resources managed by AWS via its services => services are built on top of IT infrastructure, eg. AWS EC2, AWS Lambda

AWS provides dozens of services like database services, file storage services, data analytics services and customer can rent slides of them to cover cost, different slides with different hardware specifications

AWS does heavy lifting, just click

Flexible usage of compute power, no need to maintain own data center, only pay for the resources that are used

## 03. A World Without Cloud Computing

without cloud computing => companies need to own and operate own data center and hardware, run workloads on top of that

Advantages

1. full control of physical infrastructure and hardware
2. know exactly where computers and data are (good for legal reasons)

Disadvantages

1. responsible for maintaining the infrastructure (difficult and expensive)
2. long-term capacities planning and upgrading (need to upgrade data center manually, buy and configure the machine)
3. secure the infrastructure (protect the physical machines against like catastrophe)
4. cannot react quickly to workloads (scalability)
5. pay for idle resources (unnecessary cost)
6. stuck to one or few locations of data center (have higher latency)

## 04. Cloud Advantage: Reliability
