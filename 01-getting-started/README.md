## What is React?

ReactJS => a javascript library for building user interfaces

mobile apps give great highly reactive user experience, things happen instantly and don't wait for new page to load

in traditional websites, the requests sent to the server and new html page was sent back to the browser. so we need to wait the page load.

javascript can break request-response cycle, since it is a programming language that runs in browser, it can manipulates DOM and can control what the users see without fetching new html page.

ReactJS is a client-side javascript library, all about building modern reactive user interfaces for web,
